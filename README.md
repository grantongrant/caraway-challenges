# Caraway Home Challenge - Grant Russell

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Access

This project is hosted on Heroku at  [Caraway Challenge](https://caraway-challenge.herokuapp.com/)

### Challenge One and Two CSS

Challenge One and Challenge Two can be accessed via the link above. Navigate to "Challenges."

In this repo, the CSS for Challenge One is found at src > components > Challenge One > ChallengeOne.css

In this repo, the CSS for Challenge Two is found at src > components > Challenge Two > ChallengeTwo.css

Note on Challenge Two: I found this one surprisingly difficult. I was able to do most of the CSS, but couldn't quite figure out the animated border on hover.
